Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of performing initial investigations on data. It helps to analyze and understand data by discovering patterns, sporting anomalies, testing hypothesis and checking assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representation. 
When carrying out the Exploratory Data Analysis of INSURANCE,there was usage of tools for EDA and several steps. The tools used include; Python (where there are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and plotly), Exel and Tableau. The steps followed during the analysis are;
Data Import. This step involved importing data into the preferred data analysis software or tool
Data Cleaning. This step involved, checking if there are missing values, outliers and other problems in the data and address them using the appropriate action.
Data Summary. In this step, I used descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, range quartiles and standard deviation to summarize data.
Data Visualization.The use of visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots and bar charts are used for more understanding of the data. It also helps with analysis of data such as normalizing the data, creating new variables and aggregating the data.
Data modelling. The use of ststistical models such as regression models, clustering models and classification models to analyze data.
Conclusion. The conclusion was then drawn based on the results of the Exploratory Data Analysis and the understanding is to be used in providing information for further amnalysis and modelling.
Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential step in understanding data.
